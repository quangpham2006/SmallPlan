"""Example Prompt
You are asked to construct a 2D [N] x [N] grid, consisting of water tiles (denoted by ’.’), 
land tiles (denoted by ’#’), and coconut tree tiles (denoted by ’o’). 
Coconut tree tiles are also considered as land tiles. 

A group of connected land tiles in 4 cardinal directions forms an island.

Your 2D grid must follow the following rules:
- There must be exactly [K] islands.
- The size of each island must be at least [Y] tiles.
- There must be exactly [L] islands that have coconut trees on them.
- There must be exactly [C] total coconut trees.

Print only the answer.
"""

"""Rule Constraint
Grid size 5 <= N <= 8

num islands 1 <= K <= 5
island size 1 <= Y < Z <= 10

total coconut trees should fit the minimum total land tiles (to simplify)
